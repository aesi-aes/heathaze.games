    I'm Denzi, solo indie developer of "Tales of the Laser Knights", with over 10 years of game
    development experiene (Carcassonne, Catan Universe, Toggolino, Diamond Dash, Jelly Splash).
    <br /><br />
    I started developing "Tales of the Laser Knights" in ~ April 2024, because I wanted to build a game
    like Mystic Quest (Game Boy), or the old 2d Zeldas (ALTTP, Link's Awakening), but set in a SCI-FI
    universe... it had to be Sci-Fi, since I was mostly influenced by (of course) Star Wars, Star Trek,
    Flash Gordon, and other trash sci-fi movies... not so much fantasy, but also the 80ies were heavy
    incluences: Captain Future, Indiana Jones, Ghostbusters, The Goonies, Innerspace, ... or be it the
    books by such great SF authors like William Gibson, Dan Simmons, Peter F. Hammilton... the list goes
    on and on :)
    <br /><br />
    Currently working towards a Demo Version which will include parts of the 1st planet that you will
    travel in "Tales of the Laser Knights"... it will feature an Original Soundtrack, and 2d artwork
    from Nadim "I'm not rude" Arnaout.
    <br /><br />
    Watch out for the upcoming Demo! Wishlist on Steam, if you like what you see :)
