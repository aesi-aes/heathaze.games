    On a desert planet, the young boy Zak lives a boring life on a farm. One day he meets Ramius, an
    old warrior - who tells him about the alien race of the Ancient, and how their technology (the
    Ancient Orbs) once connected all known planets. Zak’s family took care of one Ancient Orbs for
    generations. After it is stolen by unknown soldiers, Zak picks up Ramius’ old energy weapon and
    starts a journey to the all planets, to find all crystals and reestablish what once was
    humanity’s connection between the stars. On his way, he finds blueprints of new Ancient
    technology that lets him advance his weapon. Only with these new features he can fulfill all
    challenges on his path to the last planet, where he has to fight the evil powers that stole the
    Orbs in the first.
